          Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of
          Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BCE. It is a philosophy of
          personal virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views
          on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both
          necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia (happiness, lit. 'good
          spiritedness'): one flourishes by living an ethical life. The Stoics
          identified the path to eudaimonia with a life spent practicing virtue
          and living in accordance with nature.
