          Home roasting is the process of roasting coffee from green coffee
          beans on a small scale for personal <br />
          consumption. Home roasting of coffee has been practiced for centuries,
          using simple methods such <br />
          as roasting in cast iron skillets over a wood fire and hand-turning
          small steel drumson a kitchen <br />
          stovetop. Until the early 20th century, it was more common to roast
          coffee at home than to buy <br />
          pre-roasted coffee. Following World War I, commercial coffee roasting
          became prevalent, and, combined <br />
          with the distribution of instant coffee, home roasting <br />
          decreased substantially.

          Coffee production in Colombia has a reputation for producing mild,
          well-balanced coffee beans. <br />
          Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is
          the third total highest in the world, <br />
          after Brazil and Vietnam, though highest in terms of the arabica bean.
          The beans are exported to United States, <br />
          Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is grown in the
          Colombian coffee growing axis region, <br />
          while other regions focus on quality instead of volumes, such as
          Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. In 2007, <br />
          the European Union granted Colombian coffee a protected designation of
          origin status.
